# Apollo V2
Apollo V2 is my new Github project belonging to my loving bot Apollo Sixteen. It is a private bot with capabilities similar to that of most popular bots. This repository will contain commands from Apollo Sixteen that are aimed for usage by anyone who visits this Github.

## What is it meant for?

Apollo V2 is sort of the cloudbased re-make of my current bot, Apollo Sixteen (or Apollo16). The cloudbased version will include only dynamic and rather easy to use commands that currently exist on Apollo16, but require editing to better fit and adapt to bots that choose to use my code. There will be regular (as regular as I can catch up to) updates to the commands and quite possibly the core files as time goes on. I simply want to make sure anyone who decides to use Apollo V2 or any of its commands will get the most updated version of said things.

### Prerequisites

These are already included in Apollo V2's repository. However, if you do choose to copy and paste certain files or snippets of code right from the core files, you will need these dependencies:
- [node.js@recommended](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [request.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
- discord.js@11.5.1 (used in Apollo V2)
- [colorhexa (for coloring embeds)](https://www.colorhexa.com/)

## Hierarchy

Apollo V2 uses the following hierarchy:

```
commands ->
    suggestion.js
    ticket.js

node_modules
    discordjs

index.js
```
If you would like to push a command to Apollo V2, push it into `commands` to avoid confusion and clutter, or create a pull request.
