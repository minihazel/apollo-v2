# Apollo V2
Apollo V2 is my new Github project belonging to my loving bot Apollo Sixteen. It is a private bot with capabilities similar to that of most popular bots. This repository will contain commands from Apollo Sixteen that are aimed for usage by anyone who visits this Github. Not all of my commands will be listed here, only the more complete ones that are easy to use. Two examples are a full fledged ticket system and a suggestion system. The commits here will be updated as time progresses and I update my commands.
